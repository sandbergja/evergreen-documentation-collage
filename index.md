## Four types of documentation

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/edhRHN)" by Andrew Gustar
* Evergreen manual
* Contextual help
* Release notes
* Documentation for developers

## Step 1: Contributors identify and report a gap

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/bK8kbM)" by Lauren M.
* New features without documentation are [listed on the wiki](https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:documentation_needs)
* Gaps are sometimes also reported on [Launchpad with the "documentation" tag](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bugs?field.tag=documentation)
* Potential process improvement: publicize a lower-barrier way to report gaps

## Activity 1

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/5ywgxn)" by Lynn Willis
* Team 1
  * Think of something that has confused you or others about Evergreen
  * Search the manual to confirm it is a gap
  * Once you have confirmed a gap, put it in the chat
  * Enjoy the collage
* Team 2
  * Enjoy the collage
  * Find a gap in the chat
  * Write a chat message to let others know you are taking that gap
  * Add the gap to the wiki or launchpad

## Step 2: Contributors create or compile documentation

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/qvWC)" by João Tito Basto
* May be sourced from
  * Local documentation
  * Release notes
  * Conversations in emails, launchpad, IRC
  * New documentation
* Process improvements
  * solid procedures for attribution when we incorporate other docs
  * make it easy for others to remix the manual


## Activity 2

* Collage: "[Collage](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gelund/49722052843/)" by Gary Lund
* Find some Evergreen documentation online from a source *other* than the official manual
* Identify the license, if available, for that documentation
* In the chat, post a link to the documentation and what you found out about its license


## Step 3: Contributors submit documentation

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/qvWC)" by João Tito Basto
* Submit any format to the Evergreen email list
* Submit AsciiDoc as a Github Pull Request - [procedures available in the Evergreen manual](https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/eg/docs/latest/shared/how_to_contribute_docs.html)


## Activity 3 (optional)
