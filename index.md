* Human processes behind Evergreen's documentation
  * How to contribute
  * Potential process improvements

## Four types of documentation

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/edhRHN)" by Andrew Gustar
* Evergreen manual
* Contextual help
* Release notes
* Documentation for developers

## Step 1: Contributors identify and report a gap

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/bK8kbM)" by Lauren M.
* New features without documentation are [listed on the wiki](https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:documentation_needs)
* Gaps are sometimes also reported on [Launchpad with the "documentation" tag](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bugs?field.tag=documentation)
* Potential process improvement: publicize a lower-barrier way to report gaps
