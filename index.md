* Evergreen manual
* Contextual help
* Release notes
* Documentation for developers

## Steps to add to the manual

* Collage: "[Trout collage](https://flic.kr/p/3agthk)" by Faith
1. Contributors identify and report a gap
2. Contributors create or compile documentation
3. Contributors submit documentation
4. Docs Committers review and incorporate submissions


## Step 1: Contributors identify and report a gap

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/bK8kbM)" by Lauren M.
* New features without documentation are [listed on the wiki](https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:documentation_needs)
* Gaps are sometimes also reported on [Launchpad with the "documentation" tag](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bugs?field.tag=documentation)
* Potential process improvement: publicize a lower-barrier way to report gaps

## Activity 1

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/5ywgxn)" by Lynn Willis
* Team 1
  * Think of something that has confused you or others about Evergreen
  * Search the manual to confirm it is a gap
  * Once you have confirmed a gap, put it in the chat
  * Enjoy the collage
* Team 2
  * Enjoy the collage
  * Find a gap in the chat
  * Write a chat message to let others know you are taking that gap
  * Add the gap to the wiki or launchpad

## Step 2: Contributors create or compile documentation

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/qvWC)" by João Tito Basto
* May be sourced from
  * Local documentation
  * Release notes
  * Conversations in emails, launchpad, IRC
  * New documentation
* Process improvements
  * solid procedures for attribution when we incorporate other docs
  * make it easy for others to remix the manual


## Activity 2

* Collage: "[Collage](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gelund/49722052843/)" by Gary Lund
* Find some Evergreen documentation online from a source *other* than the official manual
* Identify the license, if available, for that documentation
* In the chat, post a link to the documentation and what you found out about its license


## Step 3: Contributors submit documentation

* Collage: "[shoe Repaire in the TwiLight zOne](https://flic.kr/p/cpzDE)" by Martin
* Submit any format to the Evergreen email list
* Submit AsciiDoc as a Github Pull Request - [procedures available in the Evergreen manual](https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/eg/docs/latest/shared/how_to_contribute_docs.html)


## Activity 3 (optional)

* Collage: "[Collage](https://flic.kr/p/29Qn4ZX)" street art by Murmure – Artisme, photo by Jeanne Menjoulet
* Sign up for the [Evergreen documentation email list](http://list.evergreen-ils.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/evergreen-documentation)
* Create a Github Account and [create your own fork of Evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-library-system/Evergreen)

## Step 4: Docs Committers review and incorporate submissions

* Collage: "[eye garden](https://flic.kr/p/2kjouRA)" by Tyler Hewitt
* Process improvements:
  * Add more docs committers
  * Automatically generate a preview version of the documentation when a pull request is opened

## Questions?

## Contextual help

* Collage: "[walkabout](https://flic.kr/p/5u8k4b)" by Jill Allyn Stafford.
* Mini-documentation in Evergreen screens at the point of need
* One way to do this in the staff client is the <eg-help-popover> component

## Activity 4

* Collage: "[Collage exchange](https://flic.kr/p/5A59AD)" by May
* Together, let's identify a screen in Evergreen staff client that could benefit from a help popover
* Together, let's figure out the details of placement and wording
* We will then submit the request to launchpad
 
## Release notes
 
* Collage: "[Momentos](https://flic.kr/p/eLp2cr)" by Nico Sagredo.

* For bug fixes, the release team creates brief notes 

## Developer documentation
 
* Collage: "[Collage riffs](https://flic.kr/p/yXDLNm)" by jane cornwell
